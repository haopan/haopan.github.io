        1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

        2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

        3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

        4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

                        Sketch-based modeling provides a powerful paradigm for geometric modeling.
                        Recent research had shown, sketch based modeling methods are most effective when targeting a specific family of surfaces.
                        A large and growing arsenal of sketching tools is available for  different types of geometries and different target user populations.
                        Our work augments this arsenal with a new and powerful tool for modeling complex freeform shapes by sketching sparse 2D strokes;
                        our method complements existing approaches in enabling the generation of surfaces with complex curvature patterns that are challenging to produce with existing methods.
                        <br/><br />
                            To model a desired surface patch with our technique, the user sketches the patch boundary as well as a small number of strokes representing the major bending directions of the shape.
                            Our method uses this input to generate a curvature field that conforms to the user strokes and then uses this field to derive a freeform surface with the desired curvature pattern.
                            To infer the surface from the strokes we first disambiguate the convex versus concave bending directions indicated by the strokes and estimate the surface bending magnitude along the strokes.
                            We subsequently  construct a curvature field based on these estimates, using a non-orthogonal 4-direction field coupled with a scalar magnitude field, and finally construct a surface whose curvature pattern reflects this field through an iterative sequence of simple linear optimizations.
                            <br /><br />
                            Our framework is well suited for single-view modeling, but also supports multi-view interaction, necessary to model complex shapes portions of which can be occluded in many views. It effectively combines multi-view inputs to obtain a coherent 3D shape. It runs at interactive speed allowing for immediate user feedback.
                            We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method  through a large collection of complex examples created by both artists and amateurs.
                            Our framework provides a  useful complement to the existing sketch-based modeling methods.
